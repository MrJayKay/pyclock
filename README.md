Py Clock

This is a simple digital clock I made using Python and Tkinter

This was my first project using python and a GUI.
Pretty easy, looks great! 

Some features I would like to change;

- Add more option for the GUI styles
- Add an alarm feature
- Add multiple time zones
- Explore what else I can do with Tkinter.
